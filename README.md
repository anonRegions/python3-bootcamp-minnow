Stuff I'm working on as I work through 2021 Complete Python Bootcamp
I'm learning Python as part of another training course on QA testing. I have 10+ years' experience as a QA tester, but in a very idiosyncratic & limited capacity. I've had to go back & learn all the formal processes & procedures of QA testing so I can work with teams. In my prior position, I was a one-man band in re everything except UAT, so the ability to work with teams is something I'm putting a lot of work into.
